I started my first sourdough starter earlier this week. I followed Jared's [instructions](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMzUoYAj8wM/?taken-by=jaredonline) to a tee, except on Day 3 I began feeding the starter (same proportions as Jared) every 12 hours. (Remove 200 grams starter, Add 50 grams whole wheat, 50 grams all purpose, 100 grams 110 fahrenehit water each time). Some days I used colder / hotter water, the variance was from around 100 -> 120 degree water. 

On day 5, I took out 35 grams of starter and made a levain following Jared's instructions. " I took 35g of starter, 100g of whole wheat, 100g of bread flour and 200g of 115F water and made a leaven". I then let this rest (with some jossling from being carried in a bicycle pannier) for 21 hours. I then used 227 grams of that as the sourdough starter in the King Arthur rustic sourdough recipe: http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/rustic-sourdough-bread-recipe 

ingredients:
* 227g "fed" sourdough starter
* 340g lukewarm water
* 2 teaspoons instant yeast
* 14g sugar
* 2 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 602g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour

Combine all ingredients. Rest for 90 minutes. Form into loaves. Rest for an hour. Bake at 425 degrees.
